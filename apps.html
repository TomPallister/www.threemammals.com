				Hi, First One To is a challenge game. It was inspired by a fella named Vic Jankee who came up with the idea while a group of friends were on holiday in Thailand. The original idea behind the game was that you would compete to be the first user to complete a challenge. Hence the name First One To that was provided by one Douglas John Jenkins.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over time the game evolved from the original concept. It became apparent that the original idea didn't have the longest legs. We decided that people should rate each others challenge responses with the most liked winning. The change took place but we liked the name so much we decided to keep it.
			</P>
			<p>
				The game is by no means finish and we intend to add many new features over the coming months and years..if we are lucky!
			</p>
			<p>
				We hope that you enjoy our game.
